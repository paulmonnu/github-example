    "New York City (NYC), often called the City of New York or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass.[11] With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. So I've so cherished the city and i applied for a course at New York University and got a scholarship to study predictive analysis, so with great happiness i got into the nearest flight to New York and lodge at an Hotel, Conrad New York city hotel to be precise. So at lunch time, i and some group of friends decide to ask the hotel for French meal, we all desire to have a French meal, and the hotel could not deliver such, so i had to look for the nearest restaurant on French meal close to the hotel i lodged in for the day.\n",
